# Zapier

---

Zapier enables you to automate tasks between other online apps (like Salesforce, Basecamp, and Gmail). This helps you use complementary apps side-by-side.

--

First, you set up a Zap.

--

A Zap is a blueprint for a task you want to do over and over. In words, a Zap looks like this: "When I get a new thing in A, do this other thing in B." The first part is the trigger and the second part is the action.

An example is "When I get a new entry from a Wufoo form, create a new lead in Salesforce."

You get as much granularity as you need. You can pick what fields from the trigger app should go to the action app and you can use static text and custom fields too. For instance, you might say that the phone number from your Wufoo form should be the work phone of your new Salesforce lead.

--

Once you've built a few Zaps you can monitor their activity through your dashboard
